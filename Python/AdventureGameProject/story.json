  "description": "In a forsaken realm where shadows writhe and ancient trees whisper curses, you stand alone, a weary soul thrust into a merciless forest cloaked in eternal gloom. The air is thick with menace, and unseen eyes track your every step. Malevolent forces—beasts, specters, and lords of forgotten power—lurk in the darkness, eager to test your resolve. Survival demands cunning, bravery, or sacrifice. Will you unravel the forests grim secrets, or become another lost echo in its unyielding abyss? Steel your heart, for this is no mere journey—this is a descent into destiny.",
